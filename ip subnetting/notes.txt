CIDR:

Class in IP address :

ip4 denoted by 32 bit

8.8.8.8 ==> 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000

here 8 demote no of bit.

There are total 5classes there.
1. A class (N.H.H.H) ==> no of host = 24 power of 2==> range = 1.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.0  
2. B class (N.N.H.H) ==> no of host = 16 power of 2==> range = 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
3. C class (N.N.N.H) ==> no of host = 8 power of 2==> range = 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0
4. D class
5. E class

where 
 N denote Network
 H denote Host

so ip address decide based on number of host = power of 2.



Classless Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR):

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP address allocation method that improves data routing efficiency 
on the internet. Every machine, server, and end-user device that connects to the internet has a unique number, 
called an IP address, associated with it.

It is denoted by : a.b.c.d/n
where n is the no of 1(network)

length of ip4 s 32 bit.

so no of host = 32 - n
total no of host = n power of 2.

How to calculate network id/block id of 200.10.20.40/28

Sol: here 28 denotes total number of 1 in network.
     200.10.20.00101000 
     in this except 28 bit from left to right make every other bit 0
     200.10.20.00100000 
     now convert this ip into decimal : 200.10.20.32/28 is the network id or block id(this is also fisrt ip of block)
     
     host bit = 32 -28
     size of block = total number of host = (host bit) power of 2 = (4) power of 2 = 16
     no of host means = total ip possible to distribute.


Rule:

1. address should be contiguous.
   ex : 200.10.20.32
                 .33
                 .34
                 .35
                  etc

2. No of ip address must be power of 2.
   so here "total no host = no of ip address" is 16, and 16 is power of 2.

3. Fisrt ip address of every block must be divisible by block size.

   => network id or block id is the first ip address of every block, which is divisible by 16(block size)
